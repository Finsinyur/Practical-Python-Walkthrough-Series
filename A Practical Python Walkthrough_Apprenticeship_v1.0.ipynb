    "# Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a named sequence of statements that performs a computation. To put it into perspective, it can somewhat represent a machine and its existence is to only perform what it is built for.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, one may categorize functions into some common types. Below are three general types of functions I can think of, accompanying with examples.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## A function that performs an action\n",
    "\n",
    "Such function is very basic. When given an input, it will perform its specialized task without modifying the input. An example would be a stereo speaker. With a given data (e.g. mp3 file), an electric signal is generated in the stereo speaker and converted into sound through vibrations from its diaphram. No changes is made on the mp3 file itself. Some examples of functions are:\n",
    "- ```print()```: broadcasting an input into the console\n",
    "- ```input()```: retrieves an user input and save as a variable\n",
    "\n",
    "## A function that changes the input\n",
    "\n",
    "Such function applies changes to the given input. One example would be a car washer. When you drive a dusty car into the car washer, the washer scrubs the car clean and returns a well-cleaned and shine car. Some examples of such functions are:\n",
    "- ```int()```: converts a variable type into integer\n",
    "- ```float()```: converts a variable type into float\n",
    "- ```str()```: convers a variable type int string\n",
    "- ```sorted()```: sorts a given list-type input (different from ```.sort()```)\n",
    "- ```sum()``` and any math operators: applies math operations\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/function1.png\" alt=\"Drawing\" style=\"width: 600px;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## A function that provides more information\n",
    "\n",
    "This group of functions is very similar to the first type. The only difference here is that this group of functions returns an intrinsic information of the input variable. For instance, when you step on the weighing scale, it returns you your weight. It does not modify you, nor does it do any action. Some examples are:\n",
    "- ```type()```: returns the type of the input variable\n",
    "- ```len()```: returns the length (number of elements) of a sequence data type\n",
    "- ```max()```: returns the maximum value within a sequence (highest number if sequence is numeric, otherwise largest based on unicode)\n",

    "    \n",
    "    return output\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we can easily identify a few properties:\n",
    "- ```def``` keyword: This keyword helps the program to identify that there is a function being defined\n",
    "- ```function_name()```: Every function needs to have a name. For functions, a parenthesis must accompany the function name.\n",
    "- Arguments ```arg1, arg2```: Arguments are inputs for the function. The user can define as many inputs required as required. IF there are two arguments defined within the parenthesis, the function will expect two inputs to be provided when it is being called.\n",
    "- Indentation: An indentation helps to distinguish what's within the function and what's not. Typically indented with a 'TAB' or four whitespaces (for more professional programmers). \n",
    "- Executable statements: executable statements are written within the function based on what the function is supposed to perform.\n",
    "- ```return``` keyword: the return keyword helps to distinguish the output (which comes directly after it) from other executable statement. It also marks the end of the function."

    "There are many scenarios that can result in this, but the most obvious one is a code error when one forgets to include discounting the counter. Observe in our first ```while``` loop example, we need to deduct 1 to ```i``` in each iteration in order for it to reach zero, which is the stopping condition. So if one forgets to do the discounting, infinite loop will occur and eventually crashing your program.<br>\n",

    "\n",
    "<b>Functions</b><br>\n",
    "In the previous section we have looked into how to create user-defined functions. User-defined functions allow us to create custom sets of operations which can be called by feeding in parameters - or <i>arguments</i> - and assigning the call to a variable. Arguments come in two types - a normal argument and a keyword argument (which one may set a default value to). The position of a normal argument precedes the keyword argument. A function may return one or more outputs.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we distinguished the differences between a global and a local variable. A global variable is one that is defined in the main code body, and can be summoned inside or outside a function. A local variable, however, only exists within the function it resides. Once the function is executed, the memory of the local variable will be wiped off and cannot be retrieved again.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Conditional Statements</b><br>\n",
    "It is essential in programming to write rules-based decisions such that the code can execute the correct set of instructions given the input. Here we introduced 3 types of conditional statements: ```if```-```else```, ```if```-```elif```-```else``` and nested-ifs. A simple ```if```-```else``` can only consider 2 conditions (binary), whereas the other two may consider multiple conditions (more than two).<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Iterations</b><br>\n",
    "Another important element of programming is the ability to repeat a certain set of operations. In the previous section we tested two types of iterations - the ```while``` loop and the ```for``` loop. The ```while``` loop works well with a counter or a switch, but may potentially run into an <i>infinite loop</i> problem. We also explored how we can implement both loops, and how both loops may essentially be applied to same problems. It is up to an individual's preference on which loop to use, though one loop may be more suitable than the other given situation.<br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Conditional Iterative Statements</b><br>\n",
    "Lastly, we explored how one can execute both conditional statements and iterations together to bring maximum value of a program. We also explored the use of ```continue``` and ```break``` to have better control over the flow.<br><br>"
